# Hi, I'm Dragan Spiridonov 👋

**Agentic Quality Engineer | Bridging Classical QE to the Future**

Currently building [Quantum Quality Engineering](https://quantum-qe.dev) and founding the **Serbian Agentic Foundation Chapter** - Serbia's first community for agentic engineering practices.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

### The Evolution: Classical → Agentic QE
29 years in IT - Started in 1996 doing computer repair and sysadmin, spent the last 12 years establishing and leading QA/QE functions. Built Alchemy's QA/QE organization from scratch over 8 years. 
I'm now focused on the practical evolution from traditional testing to agent-orchestrated quality systems. Not replacement - evolution.

```

## 🛠️ Current Focus

- **⚡ Quality Forge** - Open-source initiative bridging classical to agentic QE with production-tested tools and PACT principles
- **🏗️ Quantum QE Consulting** - Helping teams transform their quality practices through context-driven, PACT-based approaches
- **🇷🇸 Serbian Agentic Foundation** - Building Serbia's first Agentic QE community with StartIt centers
- **🤖 AQE Fleet** - Production-ready distributed AI testing framework with 16 specialized agents for comprehensive quality automation
- **📚 Agentic QE Framework** - Open-sourcing battle-tested patterns for agent-orchestrated testing
- **🦀 Sentinel** - Multi-agent testing orchestration system (Rust/Python)

## 💡 Core Philosophy

> "Quality must be built in, not tested in. Best practices are contextual, not universal."

I practice what I call the **Holistic Testing Model** - quality across all dimensions:
- **Testing in Production** - Reality is the ultimate test environment
- **Shift-Left AND Shift-Right** - Quality everywhere, not just in the testing phase
- **Risk-Based Coverage** - Test where it matters most
- **Whole Team Quality** - Everyone owns quality, agents augment but don't replace

## 🔧 Tech Stack

### Classical Foundation (Still Essential)
- **TDD** - Both London School (mockist) & Chicago School (classicist)
- **XP Practices** - Pair/ensemble programming, continuous integration
- **Exploratory Testing** - Session-based test management, heuristic approaches
- **Automation** - Robot Framework, Playwright, JMeter

### Agentic Evolution
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Rust for performance, Python for flexibility
- **LLM Integration** - Prompt engineering for test generation
- **Explainable AI** - Every agent decision has a traceable reason
- **PACT Framework** - Proactive, Autonomous, Collaborative, Targeted agents

## 📊 Real Impact, Not Hype

```
Classical QE Achievements:
├── 60% faster test generation with AI assistance
├── 85% reduction in test maintenance through smart automation
└── 4x improvement in defect detection with exploratory agents

Agentic QE Goals:
├── 10x improvement in test effectiveness (not just speed)
├── Self-healing test suites that evolve with the product
└── Autonomous quality orchestration with human oversight
```

### 🔮 The Future of Quality

> "We're not replacing testers with AI. We're evolving from testing-as-activity to agents-as-orchestrators. The future of quality is autonomous but explainable, proactive but controlled, collaborative but targeted. That's PACT."
